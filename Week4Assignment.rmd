## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for Week 4 Assignment which includes the Algorithm, R Code and the Visualization.


## Algorithm

1. Read movies dataset.
2. Find the mean of rating and votes for each year using ddply .
3. Sort this dataset in order of highest average votes and rating to find the year with the highest votes and rating.


## R Code
```{r}
movies <- read.table("movies.tab.gz", sep="\t", header=TRUE, quote="", comment="")
library(plyr)
mean_rate <- ddply(movies, .(year), colwise (mean, "rating")) 
mean_votes <- ddply(movies, .(year), colwise (mean, "votes")) 
result_mean <- cbind(mean_rate,mean_votes$votes)
colnames(result_mean)[3]="votes"
final_result <- arrange(result_mean, -votes, -rating)

head(final_result)   
## This shows the year 1999 being the year for best
##                           popular movies 

##year   rating    votes
##1 1999 5.637104 1364.970
##2 1995 5.739423 1213.835

```


## Visualization 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(result_mean, aes(x= rating, y= votes)) + geom_point()

```




## Conclusion
After the analysis, it is found that it was in year 1999 when the best popular movies were made.
