## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for Week 4 Assignment which includes the Algorithm, R Code and the Visualization.


## Algorithm

1. Sort the movies dataset in descending order of votes and rating. This has been done using the arrange function of plyr package.
2. Subset the sorted movies dataset to display the year along with votes and rating of movies in order to identify the "year" when best popular movies were made.
3. Create a ggplot to depict the year when best popular movies were made.

## R Code
```{r}
movies <- read.table("movies.tab.gz", sep="\t", header=TRUE, quote="", comment="")
library(plyr)
sort.movies <- arrange(movies,-votes,-rating)
subset.sort.movies <- subset(sort.movies,select=c(year,votes,rating))

##head(subset.sort.movies)   This shows the year 2001 being the year for best
##                           popular movies 

##  year  votes rating
##1 2001 157608    8.8
##2 1994 149494    9.1
##3 1999 143853    8.5
##4 1977 134640    8.8
##5 1994 132745    8.8
##6 1972 122755    9.1

```


## Visualization 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(subset.sort.movies, aes(x= rating, y= votes)) + geom_point()

```




## Conclusion
After the analysis, it is found that it was in year 2001 when the best popular movies were made.
