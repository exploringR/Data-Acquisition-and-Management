Motivation
=================================================================================

Many of us face several issues with financial products offered by various financial institutions and end up calling their customer care centers spending hours together sometimes. So when I saw this consumer complaints data openly available, I was motivated to perform the below analysis - 

- Financial Products - Highest number of complaints
- States - Where maximum complaints are filed
- Companies - Notorious receiving large number of complaints
- Yearly trend of complaints
- Monthly Average of number of complaints for each year
- Peek into company responses - Closed, In progress, Untimely responses


What Financial Products?
========================================================

- Bank accounts or services
- Consumer loans
- Credit cards
- Credit reporting
- Debt collection
- Money transfers
- Mortgages
- Private student loans
- Payday loans

Financial Products - Top number of complaints
===============================================

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}

## Download CSV data file from data.gov

##fileurl <- "https://data.consumerfinance.gov/api/views/x94z-ydhh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
##setInternet2(use = TRUE)
##download.file(fileurl,destfile="C:\\temp\\consumercomps.csv")


## Read the csv file into R
consumercomps <- read.csv("C:\\temp\\consumercomps.csv")

## Remove missing values fromthe consumercomps dataframe
consumercomps <- na.omit(consumercomps)

## Convert date columns Date.received and Date.sent.to.company to date format

library(lubridate)

temp_date_received <- gsub("/","-",consumercomps$Date.received)
temp_date_received <- mdy(temp_date_received)
consumercomps$Date.received <- as.Date(temp_date_received)

temp_date_sent <- gsub("/","-",consumercomps$Date.sent.to.company)
temp_date_sent <- mdy(temp_date_sent)
consumercomps$Date.sent.to.company <- as.Date(temp_date_sent)

## Cleanup the UTF8 characters as they are not setup to be used with Latex

temp_company <- gsub("Altisource Portfolio Solutions, S.Â. r.l.","Altisource Portfolio Solutions, S.A.r.l.",consumercomps$Company)

consumercomps$Company <- temp_company


## Change the column names

colnames(consumercomps)[13] = "Timely.response"
colnames(consumercomps)[14] = "Consumer.disputed"

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

## Find out the number of complaints for each financial product

y <- consumercomps %>%
     group_by(Product) %>%
     summarise(
           no_of_complaints = length(Complaint.ID)
            )

y <- arrange(y,desc(no_of_complaints))


## Bar plot to show the number of complaints for each finacial product

ggplot(y,aes(x=Product,y=no_of_complaints)) + geom_bar(width=0.7,fill="red",colour="black",stat = "identity") + scale_y_continuous("Number of complaints",breaks=pretty_breaks(n=10)) + theme(axis.title.x=element_text(face="bold"),axis.title.y=element_text(face="bold"),axis.text.x=element_text(angle=50,vjust=0.5,face="bold",size=10),axis.text.y=element_text(size=10,face="bold"),plot.title=element_text(vjust=1)) + ggtitle("Complaints filed against Financial Products")

```

States with maximum complaints
==============================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(plyr)
library(plotrix)

## Find the number of complaints in each state and arrange them in descending order of the number of complaints

subset_state <- filter(consumercomps, State != '')
complaints_per_state <- ddply(subset_state,c("State"),summarise,no_of_complaints=length(Complaint.ID))
rankstates <- arrange(complaints_per_state,desc(no_of_complaints))

## Find the top 10 states having the highest number of complaints and calculate the percentage of complaints

toptenstates <- slice(rankstates,1:10)
toptenstates$Percentage <- round(prop.table(toptenstates$no_of_complaints)*100,2)

slices <- toptenstates$Percentage
lbls <- toptenstates$State
lbls <- paste(lbls,slices)
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="")

## Create a 3D pie chart showing the top 10 states with their complaint percentages

pie3D(slices,labels=lbls,labelcex=0.8,radius=0.75,explode=0.1,main="Pie Chart for top 10 states with highest number of complaints")

```

Top 10 notorious companies
==========================

```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Find the top 10 companies having the highest number of complaints and calculate the percentage of complaints

complaints_per_company <- ddply(consumercomps,c("Company"),summarise,No_of_complaints=length(Complaint.ID))
rankcompanies <- arrange(complaints_per_company,desc(No_of_complaints))

## Get the top 10 companies 

topten <- slice(rankcompanies,1:10)
topten$Percentage <- round(prop.table(topten$No_of_complaints)*100,2)

slices <- topten$Percentage
lbls <- topten$Company
lbls <- paste(lbls,slices)
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="")

## Create a pie chart showing the top 10 states with their complaint percentages 

pie(slices,labels = lbls,labelcex=0.8,radius=0.45,col=rainbow(length(lbls)),main="Top 10 companies with highest no. of complaints")

```

Yearly trend of complaints
==========================

```{r,echo=FALSE}

## Find the total number of complaints per year

complaints_per_year <- ddply(consumercomps,c(Year="year(Date.received)"),summarise,no_of_complaints=length(Complaint.ID))


## Bar plot to show the yearly trend of complaints

ggplot(complaints_per_year,aes(x=Year,y=no_of_complaints)) + geom_bar(width=0.5,fill="blue",colour="black",stat = "identity")+ scale_y_continuous("Number of complaints",breaks=pretty_breaks(n=10)) + theme(axis.title.x=element_text(face="bold"),axis.title.y=element_text(face="bold"),axis.text.x=element_text(vjust=0.5,face="bold",size=7),axis.text.y=element_text(size=10,face="bold"),plot.title=element_text(face="bold",vjust=2)) + ggtitle("Yearly trend of complaints")

```

Monthly average of complaints
=============================

```{r,echo=FALSE}

## Calculate the average number of complaints per month for 2012

consumercomps_year <- subset(consumercomps,year(Date.received) == 2012) 
mean1 <- mean(ddply(consumercomps_year,c(Month="month(Date.received)"),summarise,no_of_complaints=length(Complaint.ID))$no_of_complaints)

## Calculate the average number of complaints per month for 2013

consumercomps_year <- subset(consumercomps,year(Date.received) == 2013) 
mean2 <- mean(ddply(consumercomps_year,c(Month="month(Date.received)"),summarise,no_of_complaints=length(Complaint.ID))$no_of_complaints)


## Calculate the average number of complaints per month for 2013

consumercomps_year <- subset(consumercomps,year(Date.received) == 2014) 
mean3 <- mean(ddply(consumercomps_year,c(Month="month(Date.received)"),summarise,no_of_complaints=length(Complaint.ID))$no_of_complaints)

avgcomplaints <- c(mean1,mean2,mean3)

Year <- c("2012","2013","2014")

df <- data.frame(Year,avgcomplaints)

## Bar plot to show average number of complaints per month for every year

ggplot(df,aes(x=Year,y=avgcomplaints)) + geom_bar(width=0.5,fill="orange",colour="black",stat = "identity") + scale_y_continuous("Average Number of complaints per month",breaks=pretty_breaks(n=10)) + theme(axis.title.x=element_text(face="bold"),axis.title.y=element_text(face="bold"),axis.text.x=element_text(vjust=0.5,face="bold",size=7),axis.text.y=element_text(size=10,face="bold"),plot.title=element_text(face="bold",vjust=2)) + ggtitle("Monthly average of complaints over the years")
```

Peek into company responses for the complaints filed
====================================================

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=5}

## Consider all types of Closed responses as "Closed". 

replace_companyresponse <- gsub("Closed with explanation|Closed with monetary relief|Closed with non-monetary relief|Closed with relief|Closed without relief","Closed",consumercomps$Company.response)

## Copy original consumercomps dataframe to new dataframe after replacing the string value to "Closed" for all types of Closed responses

replace_consumercomps <- consumercomps

replace_consumercomps$Company.response <- replace_companyresponse

## Find the count of company responses for the complaints for every financial product

count <- ddply(consumercomps,c(Response="Company.response","Product"),summarise,Complaints=length(Company.response))

## Arrange the company responses in descending order of the no. of complaints

count <- arrange(count,Response,desc(Complaints))


## Find the financial product which has maximum no. of complaint closures

closedcomps <- subset(count,Complaints==max((subset(count,Response == 'Closed'))$Complaints))

## Find the financial product which has maximum no. of open complaints

opencomps <- subset(count,Complaints==max((subset(count,Response == 'In progress'))$Complaints))

## Find the financial product which has maximum no. of complaints with untimely responses

untimelyrespcomps <- subset(count,Complaints==max((subset(count,Response == 'Untimely response'))$Complaints))


untimelyrespcomps$Response <- gsub("Untimely response","Untimely Resp",untimelyrespcomps$Response)

## Combine all the products with max company responses together

df <- rbind(closedcomps,opencomps,untimelyrespcomps)

print(df)
```

Challenges faced
================

- CSV File would not get downloaded from the specified link when doing so in R Markdown. Kept getting "Unsupported URL scheme" error. Surprisingly, the file was getting downloaded using R console which added to the confusion

Resolution - "setInternet2(use = TRUE)" in R Markdown

- Issue with UTF-8 unicode characters in the data. They are not setup for use with R Markdown/Latex.

Resolution - Substitute those characters using regular alphabets.
Example - LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX had to be replaced to 'A' during data cleanup


Highlights
==========

- Created this slideshow in R. 


Conclusion
==========
- <small>Number of complaints - Highest for "Mortgages" followed by Debt Collection, Credit Reporting, Credit Card, Bank Accounts/Services</small>

- <small>Number of complaints filed in a state are directly proportional to the population of the state</small>

- <small>Big banks have a large customer base which possibly is the major reason for  more number of complaints against financial products offered by them</small>

- <small>Complaints have shown an increasing trend over the years & are highest in 2014</small>
  
- <small>Mortgages have the highest Open & Closed complaints and Debt Collection has highest untimely company responses</small>
